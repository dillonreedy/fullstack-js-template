# What's left?
Implement Axios instead of fetch
Axios gives us the following over fetch:
1. Backwards compatibility
1. Easy to use response timeout
1. Automatic JSON transformation
1. Interceptors to intercept api calls and log things
1. A much easier way to implement progress bars
1. Simultaneous requests
